## Introduction

Hollywood has a long history of making computers look cool. From the 1960s to the 1990s, computers were portrayed as these magical machines that could do anything. They were often shown as being able to hack into any system, or even control the world. But in reality, computers are just machines that do what they are told. They don't have any special powers, and they can't do anything on their own.

So why do Hollywood computers make noise?

## In the Beginning

In the early days of computing, computers were very noisy. The first computers were made of vacuum tubes, which were very loud and hot. They were also very large and expensive. The first computer was the ENIAC, which was built in 1946. It weighed 30 tons and took up an entire room. It cost $500,000, which is about $5 million in today's money.

Because of this, computers were often kept in separate rooms, and the people who worked on them were called "computer operators". They would sit in front of the computer and type in commands. The computer would then do what they told it to do. This was a very slow process, and it took a long time to get anything done. That did not change when the transistor was invented in 1947. Transistors were smaller and cheaper than vacuum tubes, but they were still very noisy and hot. They were also very unreliable, and they would often break down. This meant that computers were still very expensive and unreliable.

Then NASA came along and changed everything. The world saw that a computer was used for launching stellites into space. This was a huge deal, and it made computers seem like they were worth investing in. That is why the first shows and movies featured computers in space. Think of 'Lost in Space' and 'Star Trek'. These shows made it seem like computers were the future and capable of anything.
