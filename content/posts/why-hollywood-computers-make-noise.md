[comment]: <> (An introduction about how movies and tv series have gotten more real, all but technology. Why do computers still make beeps and bops?)

## Introduction

I like movies and a good tv/streaming series as much as the next person. One of my go-to is Sci-Fi. I love the genre and the possibilities it brings. But there is one thing that always bothers me: the computers. They are always making noise. Beeps and bops and clicks and clacks. And it's not just Sci-Fi; it's most movies and series save Mr. Robot.

Why is that? Why do computers make noise in movies?

## The History of Computers in Movies

Computers have been in movies for a long time. The first movie to feature a computer was [Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)) in 1927. The computer was a robot, but it was a computer nonetheless. That was 94 years ago, but computers did not become a staple in movies and tv until the 1960s. This was the time of NASA and the race to the moon and also Lost in Space and Star Trek. Think about it, those shows were about space travel and exploration the very idea behind NASA. But unlike the computers that were used in NASA (which were real), the computers in the shows were not. They were props and were made to look futuristic and to the producers, that meant making a lot of noise. Not like the noise that I real would make at the time with using punch cards, tape drives and large cooling systems.

This however, was not dramatic enough for the producers. They wanted something that would make the audience feel like they were in the future. So they added noise. Lots of noise. And that is where the trope of computers making noise in movies and tv shows started.

Now the question is, why do computers in media still make noise? We have come a long way since the 1960s and computers are smaller and more powerful, but most of all they do not beep nor bop.

## Always the New Thing

Every since the Apple II came out computers were seen as the latest fad that was soon going to fade away. Even after more the 40 years, computers are still seen as the new thing by the majority viewers and producers and that is do to their age.
