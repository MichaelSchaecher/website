Here are some **SystemD Timer Scripts** I wrote to automate some tasks on my Virtual Machine and/or LXC Containers that help me to keep my system up-to-date and running without much need manual intervention.

- Update [Pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) Gravity and underlying Framework.
- Keep [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) DNS Resolver up-to-date.
- Clean up apt cache.
- Update [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt to the latest version.
- Keep [Vaultwarden](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) Docker container updated.

If using these scripts, please make sure to adjust the paths and commands to your needs.

> **Note:** The timer script for **Starship Prompt** only works if Starship is installed globally.

The advantage of using **SystemD** over **Cron** is that it is more reliable when it comes to running tasks at a specific time and if the time was missed. This means that **SystemD** will run the task as soon as possible after the missed time.

{{< flex src="/projects/Kernel.png" alt="Linux Kernel for WSL" class="rowLeft"

I have compiled a **Linux Kernel** for **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. This kernel is based on the based on either the mainline or stable kernel from [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/). The kernel is compiled inside WSL and can be installed on Windows 10 or Windows 11.

To use this [Kernel Patch](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/wsl-kernel-patch) you need to have the following installed development tools on your system.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential \
  flex bison libssl-dev \
  libelf-dev bc libncurses-dev
```

{{< /flex >}}

You can download the compiled kernel from [here](https://github.com/MichaelSchaecher/linux-wsl-kerenel/releases/tag/kernel-release) and install it on your system. **Note**: Don't install in the default location for the kernel. Instead, install it in a separate directory and point to it in your WSL configuration.
