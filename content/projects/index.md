Pi-hole is a useful tool for blocking ads, trackers, malware, etc. on your home network. However, the Internet is not static and neither are the lists that Pi-hole uses. So I created a set of systemd timers and services to keep the lists up to date and to keep the Pi-hole database optimized. There is also a service for updating the Pi-hole software itself, but only use at your own risk bacause it is something that Pi-hole does not endorse.
